            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sleep Beneath the Stars in the Italian Alps | Travel Away</h1><p>A brainchild of local hotelier Raniero Campigotto, Starlight Room Dolomites is a mobile glass-encased bedroom tucked away in the picturesque Italian Alps, 20 km from the swanky ski resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo. Perched at an altitude of 2,055 meters, the secluded cabin rewards those who brave the climb up with marvelous mountain views by day and pollution-free starry skies by night.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0895eb60736ea7b14be4c5d3a67591db4746a3c6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sevenhugs' Smart Remote</h1><p>Looking to simplify the endless number of apps and interfaces used to control smart-home products, French start-up Sevenhugs has introduced the first "contextually aware" universal Smart Remote. In other words, it's the first remote to understand where it is in your home and what it's pointing at, allowing users to simply point and click to control devices instead of switching between apps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df1caa77bd36920224edf22d445e863c5b829e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>
